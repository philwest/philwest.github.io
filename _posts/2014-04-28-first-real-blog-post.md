title: "My First Real Blog Post: The Post-Allegiant Air Flight Nightmare, You Actually For Real Filmed A Game Show On My Plane Blues"

---

So, a bit fried today -- not because of the Vegas trip I went on, but because of the circumstances around my flight back home. (Rant below, if you like rants.) Wrapping my head around grids. Grids are what I need. I think I'm going to like foundation. I'm trying to tweak CSS elements in this version of the site just to make sure I make it past the OH MY GOD DON'T BREAK ANYTHING WITH UGLINESS, but in my next step -- and I swear it's happening this week, I'm going to see if I can't do more with adding more elements and making grid prettiness. Maybe I'll add some buttons. 

And now, for a rant about an airline written on one of its planes: 

<i>Allegiant: Where Flying Feels Like a Hostage Situation</i>

Allegiant Air isn’t just an airline: It’s the final evolutionary step before an airline goes full truth-in-branding and calls itself Sucking All the Joy Out Of Air Travel Airlines. 

For starters, Allegiant takes the trend of airlines charging for services you’d normally taken for granted – checking bags, making phone reservations, cashing in frequent flier miles – and have extrapolated it to ridiculous extremes. With Allegiant, seat assignments will cost you, snacks and sodas and waters on the flight will cost you – I would not be surprised if the bathroom doors on planes will require a credit card swipe by year’s end. 

And it’s not just the nickel and diming of customers that makes Allegiant annoying. Seats don’t recline. Cursory online reviews reveal numerous complaints about late flights and lacking customer service. And, as I found out on a flight to Las Vegas recently, seating in a seat you don’t pay a premium for might force you into being part of the “studio audience” for a game show. 

That’s right: Someone latched onto Allegiant and its presumably willing clientele to create a game show called, moronically, “The Game Plane.” It starts at the gate, where a game show host and a crew of five camera people and a "stewardess" lead travelers through the paces – some questions, some Vegas-themed games, and a table where staffers sit in desultory fashion gamely offering waivers to people interested in participating. 

Our flight was delayed so the crew could set up its cameras in the plane’s middle exit row – anyone behind that line of cameras (including me) was asked to participate under the supposed allure of being on TV. The producer had us applaud, and then applaud again, and then laugh in true laugh track fashion, and then the game show that we couldn’t hear for the most part proceeded in front of us. 

Occasionally, the producer had us applaud, and at one point, the host came back to our rows to announce that one of the games involved a fake crying baby, because nothing brings high hilarity to a flight like a crying baby or anything created to sound like one. The host would also occasionally run up and down the aisles, creating some havoc and noise we could enjoy up close. And, from time to time, there were the calls to cheer. A guy in the row ahead of me, dressed in a meet-the-TSA-ready “I Got Bourbon Faced on Shit Street” shirt, added his own spin on the proceedings by hoisting his can of $6 Bud Light in the air whenever cheering was called upon. One lucky winner of a game involving giant playing cards that aisle-row people were asked to hold up won a limo for her and her friends – prizes were mainly in the “party in Vegas” mold, and upon exiting the plane, the host handed each of us a pack of gift cards to the Palms, which would be awesome if I were 23 and had a tribal tattoo. 

Allegiant also has peculiar rules about when you’re supposed to get to the airport. They recommend two hours for a domestic flight, which seems excessive unless your suitcase happens to be in the shape of a rocket launcher. They have an app that allows you to check in anywhere between 1 and 24 hours before the flight, but if you’re at 59 minutes out – as I learned the hard way – you can’t use it. They don’t have check-in kiosks to get boarding passes, like every other airline does. You either have to print the boarding pass out (which, let’s get real, isn’t something people do in Vegas), know about and use the app, or wait in a line to get a boarding pass. 

My only option, trying to catch a 7:25 am return flight on Sunday morning, was to wait in the line. The line constituted 15 of the longest minutes of my life – I emerged at 6:45, ID in hand, ready to brave the security, take a purposeful walk to my gate, and return home. They wouldn’t let me. They straight up refused to issue me a boarding pass, citing their rules, and after a very sassy supervisor said, “Don’t you try to get into a staring contest with me,” she told me she could fly me to Laredo or McAllen, which are cities in Texas to be sure, but cities that are 4 to 6 hours away from the city in Texas that contained my home and my job. Unpleasantries were exchanged, and after a cooling off period and a brief visit to Priceline to see non-Allegiant options, I returned to the counter to talk to someone that wasn’t the supervisor, and paid $75 to change to the next flight – at 1 p.m. on Monday. 

On Sunday afternoon, I attempted to check into the flight, and got a message saying that I was ineligible to check in to my new flight via the app. I immediately made plans to arrive at the airport two hours early. Monday morning came, and I shaved, hoping to shield my identity from Sassy Supervisor, expecting a full-on Argo experience, nervous even while en route to the airport, and only breathing easy once I was on the plane with wheels up. At the ticket counter, I was told my regulation carry-on, which rode with me on the flight to Vegas, might be too big and I’d be charged at the gate if that was the case. For all my “bring it” braggadocio on the inside, I meekly nodded on the outside, thinking about Argo, and sticking to my story. 

In the end, I made it out alive. The passenger behind me was told to turn off his electronic device and then to take his headphones out. The plane shook horribly on takeoff, and I wasn’t the only one to register alarm at what was happening around us. Snacks were sold to the hungry, the flight attendants took to sorting their email on iPads, and the flight settled into the quiet cocoon, free of game-show-chicanery, that a flight is supposed to be. 

Still, though, after the extra expense and the extra day in Vegas and the whole unpleasantness of being refused a boarding pass when it was indeed possible for me to get onto a plane that was slowly boarding one floor above where I was standing, I find myself hoping those people responsible for Allegiant’s policies burn in hell. Wait, that’s not true – I hope that those people are met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter, who then has them each pay a $75 fee to look them up in the Big Book to see if they’ve been admitted into heaven, and then hands each of them an out-of-tune harp and charges them $45 for a harp tuning, and then charges them $25 for a halo even though they have to have a halo to be admitted into Heaven, and even though people used to get halos for free just for making it to Heaven, and charges them anywhere from $15 to $50 for a cloud, except for the few crappy cirrus clouds that they don’t charge for yet. And then I hope St. Peter tells them that he’s just totally kidding before sending them to burn in hell on one of their own planes without reclining seats.
