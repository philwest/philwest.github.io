<h1>USMNT vs. Mexico</h1>
<p class="blogstyle">One thing I can say with certainty: There will not be post-match hugging in the stands on Wednesday when the U.S. faces Mexico in a imprecisely-named “friendly” at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. It’s no secret, if you follow international soccer at all, that the USMNT and El Tri have a storied rivalry. They don’t like each other very much as teams, and the fans have a history of not liking one another. This summer, when I’m working on my book, one of the first stops I’m planning to make is to hang out with Pancho Villa’s Army during the first El Tri match — these are American fans of El Tri, choosing culture and heritage as national identifiers.</p>

<p class="blogstyle">(Plus, for many Americans along the Southwest border, choosing allegiance on the basis of a homeland that was technically Mexico some 170 years ago before the U.S. took that whole westward expansion thing to the West Coast. But geography and shifting political borders don’t fully explain the phenomenon, and it’s worth exploring.)</p>

<p class="blogstyle">As much as I relish El Tri as a rival as an American soccer fan, I also love watching Mexico play as long as they’re not playing the U.S., and for all the schadenfreude this qualifying cycle brought, Mexico did get themselves into the World Cup (albeit, in the hardest way possible), and though they’ve been more fun to watch in previous World Cups, they also could put enough momentum together to get out of group and go from there.</p>

<p class="blogstyle">Also, even though there are injuries to the back four, and there are lingering questions about Altidore and Dempsey, fans are also expecting this to be the Julian Green coming out party. I expect him to start, and when the starting lineups are announced, his presence in those will make his name trend on Twitter, and if he’s on the bench, expecting tension to build until he actually gets in. American fans want to know what all the hype is about. It’s adding a layer of suspense to an otherwise engaging rivalry.</p>
