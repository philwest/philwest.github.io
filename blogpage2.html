        <h1>USMNT vs. Ukraine</h1>
        <p class="blogstyle">Questing for analysis of the U.S. Men’s National Team and its terrible outing against Ukraine on Wednesday? Brian Straus’ article for Sports Illustrated <a href="http://soccer.si.com/2014/03/05/failed-auditions-three-thoughts-on-the-usas-2-0-loss-to-ukraine/" target=_blank>isn’t a bad place to start</a>, and Ryan Rosenblatt at Stars and Stripes FC starts with the succinct headline “It Was Ugly” and <a href="http://www.starsandstripesfc.com/usmnt-friendlies/2014/3/5/5474938/usa-vs-ukraine-2014-friendly-score-report" target=_blank>takes it from there</a>. We know that both center backs made compelling cases for not including them on the team, Jozy Altidore looked like Sad Sunderland Jozy rather than Happy 2013 USMNT Scoring-A-Bunch Jozy, and Joshua Mayers pointed out, this result crowned Clint Dempsey’s recent run of woe: 0-9-1 in his last 10 matches with the Seattle Sounders, Fulham, and USMNT.</p>

        <p class="blogstyle">All of this is bad — what makes it even worse was that the Americans had to do it against an opponent who is now returning to a nation with an uncertain and troubled future, in a nation with its own unrest, in a small stadium that still stayed mostly empty. The “crowd” total might have cracked four digits, and the unhappy vocal direction of Tim Howard was clearly audible on ESPN2′s audio feed, once the sad, sickly bleating of a single fan’s noisemaking horn surrendered to the unpleasantness unfolding on the field.</p>

        <p class="blogstyle">Aside from a plaintive chant of “I believe that we can win” toward the end of a first half where that seemed more wishful than anything else, it was a silent, surreal affair, feeling far more like a unwatched scrimmage than an actual international soccer event. Hours later, Mexico and Nigeria played a match in Atlanta — and though that match ended in a scoreless tie, there was electricity, breathtaking saves from two goalies decidedly on their game, and a crowd that was engaged and alive and part of the experience of the game. For the Americans and Ukrainians, there was an absence and a disconnect that made the pallor around the game even more drawn and pale. Though it served its purpose of answering lineup questions and showing the importance of players who weren’t there, it was also a glimpse of a world in which very precious few care about American soccer, and yet an American soccer team is forced to live and play in that world. That’s not a world I ever want to live in.</p>
