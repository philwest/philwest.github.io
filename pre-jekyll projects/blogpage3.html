        <h1>American Vs. American</h1>

        <p class="blogstyle">For the last few months, I’ve been writing for Stars & Stripes FC, the SB Nation site covering U.S. soccer. Here’s my latest post, covering the Fulham vs. Sunderland match this Saturday — which doesn’t initially sound all that tempting for folks invested in English soccer let alone American soccer. But it features arguably the two best Americans in front of goal — Clint Dempsey, on loan to Fulham to help them get out of a rut for the two months he’ll be there, and Jozy Altidore, who might very well be in a goal-scoring rut for bottom-dwelling Sunderland right now, even though he’s looked brilliant for the USA against CONCACAF and European competition over the past ten months.</p>

        <p class="blogstyle">Want to see what Americans can do against “world-class players?” (That term gets thrown around quite a bit, as you might imagine.) Check it out on Premier League Extra Time at 10 am ET this Saturday.
